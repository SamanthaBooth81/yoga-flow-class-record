# About
This project collects class data from the user for the purpose of calculating and updating student attendance and earnings within the spreadsheet and to aid decision making regarding reshuffling/amending their schedule dependant on class size vs. studio capacity, and location. 

It is made with the intention of helping a small business keep their financial information in order and return to the user their busiest days.
